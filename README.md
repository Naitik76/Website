This project showcases a professional, responsive webpage designed for a Web Design & Development course. The HTML structure includes a navigation bar, main content area, and a login form, while the CSS styles emphasize a modern look with a full-screen background image, high-contrast text, and interactive elements. The design features a prominent call-to-action button, styled form inputs, and social media icons, all styled to enhance user experience and engagement. The footer remains fixed at the bottom, providing a polished finish. This project demonstrates skills in HTML and CSS, including layout design, responsive styling, and interactive features.
